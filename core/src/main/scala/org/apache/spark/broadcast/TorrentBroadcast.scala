/**
 * A BitTorrent-like implementation of [[org.apache.spark.broadcast.Broadcast]].
 *
 * The mechanism is as follows:
 *
 * The driver divides the serialized object into small chunks and
 * stores those chunks in the BlockManager of the driver.
 *
 * On each executor, the executor first attempts to fetch the object from its BlockManager. If
 * it does not exist, it then uses remote fetches to fetch the small chunks from the driver and/or
 * other executors if available. Once it gets the chunks, it puts the chunks in its own
 * BlockManager, ready for other executors to fetch from.
 *
 * This prevents the driver from being the bottleneck in sending out multiple copies of the
 * broadcast data (one per executor) as done by the [[org.apache.spark.broadcast.HttpBroadcast]].
 *
 * @param obj object to broadcast
 * @param isLocal whether Spark is running in local mode (single JVM process).
 * @param id A unique identifier for the broadcast variable.
